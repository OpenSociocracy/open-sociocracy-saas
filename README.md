## Ride along

Install Node 18 

```
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

Install CDK CLI

```
npm install -g aws-cdk

Create code dir, you must init CDK in an empty directory

```
mkdir aws
cd aws
```

Install CDK modules

```
npm install aws-cdk-lib
```

Create TypeScript CDK project

```
cdk init app --language typescript

```
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
